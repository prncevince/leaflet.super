In the works.

A plugin for [{leaflet}](https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet) to add "super" features.

The original idea is to create a `addSupClust()` function for adding a [supercluster](https://github.com/mapbox/supercluster) layer by integrating supercluster with the [Apache Arrow in JavaScript](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/js/index.html) module & the [{htmlwidgets}](https://github.com/ramnathv/htmlwidgets) package.

Also interested in creating a `addGeoJSONvt()` function for adding a [geojson-vt](https://github.com/mapbox/geojson-vt) layer for GeoJSON Vector Tiles.

The [Demos](./articles/#demos) are experiments. Some push the limits of your browser & will require you to continue waiting for responsiveness.

More soon ...
